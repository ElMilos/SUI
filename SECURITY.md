🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability
At this stage of the project, we are currently evaluating and planning our approach to security and vulnerability reporting.

If you believe you have found a security issue, we still encourage you to report it privately via email at: votesentry@gmail.com

Although we do not have a formal security response process yet, we will make every effort to:

Acknowledge your report as soon as possible

Investigate the issue seriously

Apply fixes in upcoming versions if confirmed

Thank you for helping us build a more secure project!
