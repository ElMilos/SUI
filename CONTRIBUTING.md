# 🧩 Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, and this document outlines the process to help you get started.

## 🚀 Getting Started

2. **Clone** your fork locally and set up the development environment.
3. Read and follow the project's [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🛠️ Contribution Process

- Ensure your changes are **focused and atomic** – one change per commit or PR.
- Follow the **existing code style** and conventions.
- Add **clear comments** if your code introduces complex logic.
- If possible, include **unit tests** for new functionality.
- Run all tests before opening a pull request.
- Keep your branch up to date with the latest changes from `main` (or `develop`).

## 🔍 Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an [Issue](../../issues) with as much detail as possible. Use labels to indicate the type (bug, enhancement, question, etc.).

## 📦 Code Style & Commit Messages
